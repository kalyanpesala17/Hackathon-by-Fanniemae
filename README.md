## Fannie Mae Hackathon Challenge 2019:
 - Analyze and visualize the differences in "risk factors" over 15 years
 - Did things like the number of borrowers, amount of down payment, or initial credit score have an impact on the loan's ultimate status?
 - Work with a subset of data from (2004, 2008, 2012,2016) 3rd quarter to discover how risk factors related to loan status changed over time?
 -  Bonus points will be awarded if you build a classifier or neural network model that can effectively predict whether a loan will go into default or pay off early. You should build one model for each years worth of data included in the challenge.
